## 1. INTRODUCTION

This is the source code of [***HPN-CR: Heterogeneous Parallel Network for SAR-Optical Data Fusion Cloud Removal***]. In this work, a heterogeneous parallel network for cloud removal (HPN-CR) is proposed to achieve effective cloud removal in high cloud coverage scenarios.

The architecture of *HPN* is shown as follows.

## 2. DATASET

We ues the public large-scale dataset named SEN12MS-CR, which contains triplets of cloudy Sentinel-2 optical images, cloud-free Sentinel-2 optical images and Sentinel-1 SAR images.

You can get more details about this dataset at [here](https://mediatum.ub.tum.de/1554803) and directly download the source SEN12MSCR dataset at [download](https://mediatum.ub.tum.de/1554803). 

All ROIs were divided into training, validation, and test datasets as well as [PatrickTUM](https://github.com/PatrickTUM/SEN12MS-CR-TS). You can also directly refer to `SEN12MS-CR/split.txt`.

You need to place the files from the source SEN12MSCR dataset into the corresponding source_folder under train, test, and val based on the above division, and then run :
```
python SEN12MS-CR/get_images.py
```

Finally, batch rename all the images to remove the "s1", "s2", and "s2_cloudy" markers from their names. 

ðŸš€ **The processed test portion can be downloaded directly from [here](https://aistudio.baidu.com/datasetdetail/316553).**

The constructed file structure in your computer should be shown as follows: 
```
